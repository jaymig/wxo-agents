# Hello World API

!!! note
     This tutorial ruses the Insomnia HTTP client to interact with the Watsonx Orchestrate APIs.  You can download Insomnia from [the Insomnia web site.](https://insomnia.rest/download).

## Pre requisite

This API section assumes that you have installed the [Hello World Agent](../wxo-agents/hello-world.md){target="_blank"}.  If that is not the case, please go back and install that agent on your AWS SaaS tenant.


## Let's go

Ready to get started?  The first API call we will make is to fetch your [authorization token](./api-authentication.md).
